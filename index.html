    <h1>Forteen points of jinnah</h1>
    <p><q>The Fourteen Points of Jinnah were proposed by Muhammad Ali Jinnah in response to the Nehru report. It
            consisted
            of four Delhi proposals, the three Calcutta amendments, demands for the continuation of separate electorates
            and
            reservation of seats for Muslims in government services and self-governing bodies. In 1928, an All Parties
            Conference was convened in reaction to the Simon Commission appointed to discuss parliamentary reform in
            British
            India. A committee was set up under Motilal Nehru which prepared the "Nehru Report". This report demanded
            "Dominion Status" for India. Separate electorates were refused and the reservation of seats for the Muslims
            of
            Bengal and Punjab was rejected. The Nehru Report did not uphold a single demand of the Muslim League. In
            reaction to the Nehru Report, the League authorised Jinnah to draft in concise terms the basis of any future
            constitution for India. Jinnah aimed to safeguard the interests of Muslims. He gave his 14 points which
            covered
            the interests of Muslims and in these 14 points Jinnah stated it was the "parting of ways" and that he did
            not
            want anything to do with the Indian National Congress in the future. The League leaders motivated Jinnah to
            revive the Muslim League and give it direction. As a result, these points became the demands of the League
            and
            greatly influenced the Muslims' thinking for the next two decades until the establishment of Pakistan in
            1947.</q>
